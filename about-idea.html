  <h1>About Idea</h1>
  <p>The idea for the notes-providing website came to me from my <span>own experience</span> as a student. I often faced the challenge of trying to get notes from classmates or seniors, only to be told, <span>"make your own notes."</span> This struggle to access quality study materials made me realize how frustrating it can be for students who want to excel but lack the resources. To solve this, I decided to create a platform where students can easily access top-quality notes—whether they're topper notes or provided by faculties—so <span>no one</span> has to face the <span>same problem</span> I did.</p>
